Scripts for scheduling print quality diagnostics reports (PQ Diagnostics) on HP printers, for Windows, MacOS and Linux.<BR>
(At least these scripts work on my HP OfficeJet Pro 8710 / 8715 series printer from Windows, MacOS and Linux devices. Appreciate feedbacks in the [issues](https://github.com/Vegz78/pqdiag/issues) section on whether the scripts work or not for other HP printers!)
